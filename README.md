# Pro Gemini

This project uses the power of Google Gemini, a cutting-edge AI model that can handle text, images, audio, and code, to create a seamless chatbot experience. The project leverages the google_gemini package for Flutter, which provides a simple and efficient way to integrate Geminiâ€™s capabilities into your app. The project also uses the Gemini-pro-vision model, which can perform vision-related tasks such as captioning and identifying images. The goal of this project is to build a chatbot that can understand and respond to users in a truly human-like way, using both text and image inputs.
